# RDSW_parse
turns RDSW brokered logs into pawn strings - all records, last 10, last 5.

#requires
python 3...probably could work on python2, but that's not what I did.

#run
download
open terminal, CD to the dir
run $ python3 rdsw.py
select your 'World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/<account name>/SavedVariables/RDSW.lua' file
enjoy the pawn strings!

lemme know if you've got requests.
